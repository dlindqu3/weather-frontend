## notes
- model login/signup routes & pages off Udemy? 

## jest setup 
- for axios & jest to work together correctly, I set up the __mocks__ folder in src, which set up "mock functions" 
- from the JEST documentation: "Mock functions are also known as "spies", because they let you spy on the behavior of a function that is called indirectly by some other code, rather than only testing the output. You can create a mock function with jest.fn()."
